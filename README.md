<div>
 <body>
   <div class="subtitle">A/V</div>
   <div class="contents">Trinity Hall has great A/V with the capacity to push content to the screen wirelessly.  However, unless everyone is kicked off the wifi prior to the event, the powerpoint should be run off of an HDMI cable otherwise you may have to continually restart.  The AV system is also fairly intuitive and has capabilities for playing music from an iphone.  Jack Devlin, Charlie and Derek Ferguson all have knowledge of the system.

  <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Auction or Raffle</div>
      <div class="contents">Over the years the following have been done successfully:<br>
      <br>
      Raffle Tickets sold night of for items like cupcakes for the table or outside donations like dinner a local restaurants. <br>
      <br>
      Live/Silent Auctions for items specific to Trivia Night such as Charlie to sit at a table for a specific round or a text book that might have been used to create the questions.<br>
      <br>
      This is really a decision made year-to-year by the chairs
    </body>
  </div>

 <div>
   <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Booze</div>
      <div class="contents">The past few years the Father’s club has taken on purchasing all the drinks for the bar and staffing the bar night of.  God willing they will do it forever!!!
    </body>
 </div>
  
 <div>
   <body>
     <div class="subtitle">Chair's Meetings</div>
     <div class="contents">Chairs decide how they want to schedule regular meetings and check-ins but there are 2 important meetings to include in the event calendar.<br>
      <br>
      An initial meeting to decide theme and general plan. <br> 
      <br>
      A “dress reheasal” meeting the weekend prior to the event where the questions and clues are read aloud and discussed.  If possible, the emcees should be invited.
     </body>

  <body>
    <div class="subtitle">Costco</div>
    <div class="contents">
     A good place to go day of for salad and snacks.  See “Quantities” for details.
  </body>
</div>
  
<div>
  <body>
    <div class="subtitle">Deliverables</div>
    <div class="contents">
    <div class="list2"><ul><li>Top Secret Master Document with   ALL Questions, Answers and Clues</li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tqh5WAQORLaRBuPsxbJg6b84hnaFOfD18dz7x5HSDl4/edit#slide=id.p82">PowerPoint with Questions</a></li>
      <li>PowerPoint with the Questions Answered (and Thank yous!)</li>
      <li>Servers Packet with all questions, answers and     hints that you want available for SALE</li>
      <li>Answer Sheets for each team to fill in</li>
      <li>Answer KEY – An answer sheet with the answers       filled in for the judges</li>
      <li>Score Sheet – A spreadsheet with the teams and rounds so that the judges can keep track of the points</li></ul></div>
    </body>
  </div>

  <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Emcees</div>
      <div class="contents">This is a challenge.  You want a balance between someone who will be so focused on entertaining the crowd that you’ll run behind and someone who just reads the questions.  Two people seem to work well because they can play off of each other.  Some banter is good but not too much.
    </body>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Event Timeline</div>
      <div class="contents"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oVjZYy1rZjC7ZIDlYAqFBwOvZfd6qlMO8sQx2attDI0/edit#gid=1893740994">See this sample timeline.</a><br><br>  Typically the night will include: 
      <div class="list2"><ul><li>4 rounds of questions</li><li>2 “lightening” rounds (although this is a newer addition and replaced a 5th round)</li><li> FINAL QUESTION.</li></ul></div>
      Spend some time really working this out so that you are not trying to call things in the moment.  “Negotiations” take awhile so plan for that by perhaps showing the “Answers/Thank you PowerPoint” and having a musical interlude.
    </body>
  </div>

  <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Final Exam - Negotiation</div>
      <div class="contents">So the judges will keep a pretty “true” score up until the final rounds.  The difference between the end of the final round and the final question will be $$.  At some point a team will likely made themselves known to either the judges, emcee, server or chairs that they are interested in the win.  Then it simply talking with the other servers to see if there are other “bids.”  Charlie is especially helpful during this negotiation.  The Chairs and Charlie should make the final decision together.

      <div class="subtitle">Funny Money</div>
      <div class="contents"> There is funny money in the storage locker.  See it here: Funny Money
      <div class="list2"><ul><li>$1 – Charlie</li><li>$5 – Father Kevin</li><li>$10 – Pope Francis</li></ul></div>
   </body>
 </div>
      
  <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Judging</div>
      <div class="contents"> The judges are critical to the night.  Make sure to hand pick the volunteers you want for this role.  Several folks (Mike Gill, Michael Linson, Walter Stone) have done it repeatedly and you may want to ask them if they want to repeat. 
    </body>
  </div>
  
 <div>
   <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Marketing</div>
      <div class="contents">The Marketing for Trivia Night will hopefully start with a Save-the-Date flyer announcing the theme at the HTS Golf Classic.  If not, then a couple of Save-the-Date announcements in the Tuesday newsletter before the holidays are a good idea.  <br><br>
      The majority of the marketing will happen after the return from holidays with:<br>
      <div class="list2"><ul><li>Banners (see above)</li>
      <li>Announcements in each of the Tuesday Newsletters (6-8 weeks)</li>
      <li>A flyer in Tuesday Folder (2 times) – this is also known as the FAQ.  Review it here.</li>  
      <li>Announcements from the Room Parents</li> 
      <li>A Class Representative that sends an email to their respective classes acting as a “table” lead.</li> 
      <li>Two to three “Constant Contact” dedicated email blast</li> </ul></div>
   </body>
 </div>
   
<div>
  <body>
    <div class="subtitle">Music &/or Band</div>
    <div class="contents">It is our strong recommendation that you have live music if you can.  The Basement Riot (aka HTS Dads seem to really enjoy playing this event.  Contact John Carroll-Gavula).  If not, then definitely have a play list that can be used before and after and during the transitions between rounds.

     <div class="subtitle">Questions</div>
      <div class="contents"><h3>The key to the evening!</h3>You cannot start on this early enough!!!  
        <br>A Google form for collecting questions is a good way of organizing.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NhERR8ZyvpVdgn4hbWXphmylr73L7A43FSN2porUwPc/edit?usp=drive_web">Here is what was used in 2016.</a>  Charlie also can help identify teachers who want to help create the questions.  <br>
        <br>
        The sweet spot is finding fun questions that require the team to purchase a clue or two to get to the answer but not so hard that people just give up.  </div>

  <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Registration</div>
      <div class="contents">The registration table will need a square, a list of all pre-registered and whether or not they have pre-purchased clue bucks.  They will also need a list of the table assignments and perhaps a seating chart.
   </body>
 </div>
  
<div>
  <body>
    <div class="subtitle">Set-Up</div>
    <div class="contents">
    The HTS facilities team will set up all of the tables.  Between decorating the tables and other general set-up requirements you’ll want to make sure you have at least a couple of strong volunteers leading this.  This is also a great job for kids needing service hours, they can help get snacks on the table, set up for dinner service, build the serve packets.<div class="image"><img scr="images/TNDiagram.jpg" alt="Trivia Night Diagram"</img></div>
  </body>
</div>
      
<div>
  <body>
     <div class="subtitle">SERVERS</div>
     <div class="contents"><div class="h3">The STARS of the night.</div>  These folks are the Chief Development Officers of Trivia Night.  You want to make sure they understand that role that they are trying to get money out of the table to which they’ve been assigned.  They can run errands for a fee, they can give hints for a fee, they can make up hints for a fee, they can give the answer for an even bigger fee.  They should also be communicating with the chairs about how the table is doing…if the table is having fun etc…
   </body>

  <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Standings</div>
       <div class="contents"> Should be announced twice before going into the Final Question.
     </body>
   </div>
  
 <div>
    <body>
      <div class="subtitle">Table Assignments</div>
      <div class="contents">You will want at least 2-3 bankers night of who are selling out more clue bucks as people need them but also COUNTING what money tables are giving each round.  The bankers should alert the judges and chairs to those table giving significant amounts of money.  (Chairs may decide to award those teams additional points per round and will also want to talk to those tables approaching the final round.)
